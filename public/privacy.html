                <p>
                    We are pleased that you are visiting our website. The protection of your privacy and the protection of your personal data, the so-called personal
                    data, when using our website is an important concern for us.
                </p>

                <p>
                    According to Art. 4 No. 1 of the GDPR, personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes, for
                    example, information such as your first and last name, your address, your telephone number, your e-mail address, but also your IP address. Data for
                    which no reference to your person can be established, such as through anonymisation, is not personal data. Processing (e.g. collecting, storing,
                    reading, querying, using, transmitting, deleting or destroying) according to Art. 4 No. 2 DS-GVO always requires a legal basis or your consent.
                    Processed personal data must be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing has been achieved and there are no longer any legally prescribed
                    retention obligations to uphold. Here you will find information about the handling of your personal data when visiting our website. In order to
                    provide the functions and services of our website, it is necessary for us to collect personal data about you. We also explain to you the type and
                    scope of the respective data processing, the purpose and the corresponding legal basis and the respective storage period.

                    If you use this website without transmitting data to us in any other way (e.g. by registering or using the contact form), we collect technically
                    necessary data via server log files that are automatically transmitted to our server, including:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IP address</li>
                    <li>Date and time of the request</li>

                necessary for the provision of a website and thus serves to protect a legitimate interest of our company. c) Storage period As soon as the aforementioned
                personal data is no longer required to display the website, it will be deleted. The collection of the data for the provision of the website and the
                storage of the data in log files is mandatory for the operation of the website. Consequently, there is no possibility for the user to object to this
                aspect. Further storage may take place in individual cases if this is required by law. 4. use of cookies a) Nature, scope and purpose of data processing
                We use cookies. Cookies are small files that are sent by us to the browser of your terminal device during your visit to our website and stored there. Some
                functions of our website cannot be offered without the use of technically necessary cookies. Other cookies, on the other hand, enable us to perform
                various analyses. For example, some cookies can recognise the browser you are using when you visit our website again and transmit various information to
                us. We use cookies to facilitate and improve the use of our website. Among other things, cookies enable us to make our website more user-friendly and
                effective for you by, for example, tracking your use of our website and determining your preferred settings (e.g. country and language settings). If third

                website within your networks. Configuration of the browser settings Most web browsers are preset to automatically accept cookies. However, you can
                configure your browser so that it only accepts certain cookies or not at all. However, we would like to point out that you may then no longer be able to
                use all the functions of our website. You can also delete cookies already stored in your browser via your browser settings. Furthermore, it is possible to
                set your browser so that it notifies you before cookies are stored. Since the various browsers can differ in their respective functions, we ask you to use
                the respective help menu of your browser for the corresponding configuration options. Disabling the use of cookies may require the storage of a permanent
                cookie on your computer. If you subsequently delete this cookie, you will need to deactivate it again. (b) Legal basis Based on the purposes described,
                the legal basis for the processing of personal data using cookies is Art. 6 (1) lit. f) DS-GVO. If you have given us your consent to the use of cookies on

                processing You can comment on articles on our website. When you comment on a post, we collect and store the data you enter in the input mask. In addition
                to the comments you leave, information on the time of comment entry and possibly the user name (pseudonym) you have chosen will also be stored and
                published. Furthermore, the IP address assigned by the Internet service provider (ISP) of the person concerned is stored. A transfer to third parties does
                not take place. (b) Purpose and legal basis The data transmitted by you (e.g. the IP address) is used for security reasons and in the event that the
                person concerned infringes the rights of third parties by posting a comment or posts illegal content. No disclosure of this personal data collected will
                be made to third parties, unless such disclosure is required by law or is necessary for the legal defence of the controller. The legal basis for the
                processing of personal data transmitted when using the comment function is, if and insofar as your consent is given, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a) DS-GVO. You
                can revoke this consent at any time. The legality of the data processing operations already carried out remains unaffected by the revocation. Further
                legal basis is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DS-GVO. We have a legitimate interest in processing if third party rights are violated or illegal content is posted.
                This is for security purposes in case someone writes unlawful content in comments and posts (insults, forbidden political propaganda, etc.). c) Storage
                period The comments and the associated data (e.g. IP address) are stored and remain on our website until the commented content has been completely deleted
                or the comments have to be deleted for legal reasons. 11. contact form (a) the nature and extent of data processing On our website, we offer you the
                opportunity to contact us via a form provided. In the context of sending your request via the contact form, reference is made to this data protection
                declaration in order to obtain your consent. If you make use of the contact form, the following personal data will be processed: - salutation -first name
                - last name - title -Company - line of work - function - street - street number - postal code -Location - country - email address - telephone number -
                subject - Message content (b) Purpose and legal basis The specification of your e-mail address serves the purpose of sending you an answer to your inquiry
                by e-mail. When using the contact form, your personal data will not be passed on to third parties. The legal basis for the processing is consent in
                accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) DS-GVO on the basis of the declaration of consent given voluntarily by you in the following and which can be
                revoked at any time for the future: c) Storage period The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke
                your consent to store it, or the purpose for storing the data no longer applies (e.g. after we have completed processing your request). Mandatory
                statutory provisions - in particular retention periods in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB) or the German Fiscal Code (AO) - remain
                unaffected by this. 12. contact possibilities by e-mail On our website you have the possibility to contact us by e-mail. (a) the nature and extent of data
                processing You can contact us by e-mail. Our data collection is limited to the e-mail address of the e-mail account used by you to contact us as well as
                the personal data provided by you as part of the contact. (b) Purpose and legal basis The purpose of the data processing is to be able to answer your
                request appropriately. The legal basis for this is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f) DS-GVO. There is a legitimate interest in the processing of the above-mentioned
                personal data in order to be able to process your request appropriately. c) Storage period The duration of the storage of the above data depends on the
                background of your contact. Your personal data will be deleted regularly if the purpose of the communication no longer applies and storage is no longer
                necessary. This may result, for example, from the processing of your request. 13. newsletter (a) the nature and extent of data processing On our website
                there is the possibility to subscribe to a free regular e-mail newsletter. In order to be able to send you the newsletter regularly, we need your e-mail
                address. For the newsletter dispatch we use the so-called double opt-in procedure. This means that we will only send you an e-mail newsletter once you
                have expressly confirmed that you consent to receiving the newsletter. We will then send you a confirmation e-mail asking you to confirm that you wish to
                receive future newsletters from us by clicking on an appropriate link. This serves to ensure that only you, as the owner of the specified e-mail address,
                can subscribe to the newsletter. Your confirmation must take place promptly after receipt of the confirmation email, otherwise your newsletter
                registration will be automatically deleted from our database. When you subscribe to the newsletter, we collect and store the data you enter in the input
                mask (e.g. last name, first name, e-mail address). When you register for the newsletter, we also store your IP address entered by your Internet service
                provider (ISP) as well as the date and time of registration in order to be able to trace any possible misuse of your e-mail address at a later date. In
                the case of the confirmation e-mail sent for control purposes (double opt in e-mail), we also save the date and time of the click on the confirmation link
                and the IP address entered by the Internet service provider (ISP). (b) Purpose and legal basis The data collected by us when you register for the
                newsletter will be used exclusively for the purpose of advertising in the newsletter. The processing of your e-mail address for the newsletter dispatch is
                based, in accordance with Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. a) DS-GVO and § 7 Para. 2 No. 3 UWG, on the declaration of consent given voluntarily by you below, which can
                be revoked at any time for the future. In addition, the processing is based Art. 6 para 1 lit f) DS-GVO due to legitimate interests of us to document the
                proof of the required consent. c) Storage period Your e-mail address will be stored as long as you have subscribed to the newsletter. After unsubscribing
                from the newsletter, your email address will be deleted unless you have expressly consented to further use of your data. 14. tracking and analysis tools
                An exact overview of the web analytics and social media tools we use can be found here . 15. data security and backup measures We are committed to
                protecting your privacy and treating your personal data confidentially. To this end, we take extensive technical and organizational security precautions,
                which are regularly reviewed and adapted to technological progress. This includes, among other things, the use of recognized encryption methods (SSL or
                TLS). However, data disclosed unencrypted, for example, if this is done by unencrypted e-mail, can possibly be read by third parties. We have no influence
                on this. It is the responsibility of the respective user to protect the data provided by him or her against misuse by means of encryption or in any other
                way. 16. changes to the privacy policy We reserve the right at any time to update this statement as necessary.
